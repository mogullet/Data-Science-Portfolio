# Project 1: Applied Data Analysis and Visualization of Offences in the UK for 2014 and 2015 :Project Brief

# Downloaded, refined and integrated datasets from a twenty-four month period of Crown Prosecution Service Case Outcomes by Principal Offence Categoryfrom the data.gov.uk website (link: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/89d0aef9-e2f9-4d1a-b779-5a33707c5f2c/crown-prosecution-service-case-outcomes-by-principal-offence-category-data). 

# Applied data  analytics  tools  and  techniques related to descriptive and predictive analytics on the integrated dataset. Developed  a  prediction  model  using  one  linear  regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique.

# Prepared a report containing: a.Definition  of,  at  least,  two  different  hypothesis  based  on  the  currentdataset; b.Explained  and  justified  cleaning /  integration  techniques  used in the dataset; c.Analysed and interpretated results using descriptive analytics; d.Implemented   a   prediction   model   using  one   linear   regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique; e.Critically reviewed the data analytics tools and techniques used. Analysed  the effectiveness  of  the  techniques  used,  discussed alternative  solutions  and  compare  strengths  and  weakness  between them; f.Critically  reviewed the  visualisation  tools  used, analysed  the effectiveness of the visualisation tools used, discussed alternative solutions and compared strengths and weakness between them.
