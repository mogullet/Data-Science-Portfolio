##Project 1: Applied Data Analysis and Visualization of Offences in the UK for 2014 and 2015 :Project Brief

Download, refine and integrate datasets from a twenty-four monthperiod of Crown Prosecution Service Case Outcomes by Principal Offence Categoryfrom the data.gov.uk website (link: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/89d0aef9-e2f9-4d1a-b779-5a33707c5f2c/crown-prosecution-service-case-outcomes-by-principal-offence-category-data). Apply data  analytics  tools  and  techniques related to descriptive and predictive analytics on the integrated dataset. Develop  a  prediction  model  using  one  linear  regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique.
Prepare a report containing: a.Definition  of,  at  least,  two  different  hypothesis  based  on  the  currentdataset;b.Explanation  and  justification  for  any  cleaning/integration  technique  usedin the dataset;c.Analysis and interpretation of results using descriptive analytics;d.Implementation   of   a   prediction   model   using   one   linear   regressiontechnique, one clustering technique and one classification technique;e.Critical review of the data analytics tools and techniques used. You haveto  analyse  the effectiveness  of  the  techniques  you  have  used,  discussalternative  solutions  and  compare  strengths  and  weakness  betweenthem;f.Critical  review  of  the  visualisation  tools  used.  You  have  to  analyse  theeffectiveness of the visualisation tools you have used, discuss alternativesolutions and compare strengths and weakness between them.
